# Apani Mobile Development
Apani Mobile Development is a comprehensive guide that outlines the roadmap and technologies used in the development of the Apani mobile application.

## App Development Roadmap
1. **Implementation to Design: Using Figma**

The first step in the app development process is implementing the app's design using Figma. Figma is a collaborative design tool that allows designers and developers to work together seamlessly. By utilizing Figma, the design team can create interactive and visually appealing UI/UX designs for the Apani app.

2. **Implementation to App: Using Kotlin and Retrofit**

After finalizing the design, the implementation phase begins. The Apani app is built using Kotlin, a modern programming language for Android development. Kotlin provides a concise and expressive syntax, making the development process more efficient.

In addition, Retrofit is used as the networking library to handle connections with the backend API. Retrofit simplifies the process of making HTTP requests and handling responses, making it an excellent choice for seamless API integration in the Apani app.

3. **Integration of Machine Learning: Using TFLite**

To enhance the functionality of the Apani app, machine learning capabilities are integrated. TFLite (TensorFlow Lite) is employed to incorporate machine learning models into the app. TFLite provides a lightweight and efficient solution for running machine learning models on mobile devices, enabling features like crop recommendation and plant disease detection.

By leveraging TFLite, the Apani app can provide accurate and real-time insights to farmers, helping them make informed decisions about crop selection and identifying plant diseases.
