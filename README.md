# Apani - Machine Learning Path

Welcome to the Machine Learning branch of Apani! 
This branch focuses on the development of the crop recommendation and plant disease detection features using machine learning algorithms. This README provides an overview of the branch and lists the datasets used for these features.

## Crop Recommendation

The crop recommendation feature utilizes machine learning algorithms to suggest suitable crops based on the user's geographical location, temperature, and air humidity. To develop and train the crop recommendation model, we have used the following dataset:

- [Crop Recommendation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/plant-disease-recognition-dataset): This dataset contains crop data, temperature, and air humidity. It serves as the foundation for training the crop recommendation model.



## Plant Disease Detection

The plant disease detection feature employs machine learning algorithms to analyze images of plants and detect potential diseases or pests. To build an accurate and robust plant disease detection model, we have utilized the following dataset:

- [Plant Disease Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset): This dataset comprises a diverse collection of plant images, including healthy plants, rusty plant, and powdery plant. It serves as the training data for our plant disease detection model.



Thank you for your interest in the machine learning branch of Apani! We hope to create powerful and accurate crop recommendation and plant disease detection features that will assist farmers in making informed decisions and improving their farming practices.
